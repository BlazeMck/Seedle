</head>
<h3 id="rules">
    Welcome to Seedle, the Stardew Valley Crop guessing game. In Seedle your objective is to guess what crop is the correct one by comparing the attributes of crops with ones that 
    you have guessed to ones within Stardew Valley. When you make a guess the game will inform you if your guess is too high or too low on six categories: Season, Cost, Value, Growth
    Time, Energy Given, and Health Given.<br><br>
    Some key notes: Season assumes first available season to plant. Spring is the lowest value and Winter is the highest. Cost assumes the seeds are purchased from Pierre's or most 
    available source, such as Sandy or Travelling Merchant if not sold at Pierre's. Cost will be 0 if the seeds are found instead of purchased. Value, Energy Given, and Health Given
    all assume standard quality, no silver, gold, or iridium quality. And Growth Time assumes base growth time, no Speed-Gro is taken into account. Energy Given and Health Given
    will be 0 if the item is inedible.
